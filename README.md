# Inventory-Example

This is pulled from an old project that has since been lost to a hard drive failure, it features my first go at a 
modular inventory system based on ScriptableObjects. The project had 3 distinct inventories which all used the same
code, one for spells, one for the hotbar (first 3 slots were strictly weapon slots, the rest of the slots were 
generic), and one 'full' inventory that was opened using [TAB]. 

It took some time to fully refine the structure of the system and decide on how the mechanics would work from a
design perspective, such as the limited weapon and spell storage, and how the player would interact with their spells. 
There was also much more content based around this system that I had never gotten to, while developing this system 
I was also clarifying the vision for the game and took some time to work on complex spells and spell combos as well
as the enemy AI. That said this was developed within my first 6 months of working in Unity and I felt very accomplished 
with the system and what I had learned along the way.
