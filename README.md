# Inventory-Example

This is pulled from an old project that has since been lost to a hard drive failure, it features my first go at a 
modular inventory system based on ScriptableObjects. The project had 3 distinct inventories which all used the same
code, one for spells, one for the hotbar (first 3 slots were strictly weapon slots, the rest of the slots were 
generic), and one 'full' inventory that was opened using [TAB]. 

It took some time to fully refine the structure of the system and decide on how the mechanics worked, such as the limited
weapon and spell storage, and how the player would interact with their spells. That said this was developed within my
first 6 months of working in Unity and I felt very accomplished with the system and what I had learned along the way.
